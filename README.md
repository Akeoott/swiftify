# Swiftify

a spotify player for desktop, built with Qt Quick on top of a Rust core that
wraps [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot). it follows
Material 3 Expressive (heavy inspo from end4) and has an immersive player,
synced lyrics, visualizers, an equalizer, and local files with local playlists
where u can edit the tracks metadata.
![Alt text](/assets/home.png)
this apps purpose is to replace spotifys heavy webview client, but its also mostly eyecandy lol
it runs significantly lighter than the spotify client.

**EVEN WITH THE EYECANDY TURNED ON....** it is lighter than spotify + spotifys renderers both on cpu AND ram!!!!!

id recommend turning the visualizers and background off if the app runs in the background tho lol

anyways runs on linux (made for wayland and hyprland) and macos. haven't tested winslop though...

## previews

## Before you start

- **spotify premium.** playback goes through librespot, and that only works with premium.
- **a spotify client id.** your library, playlists and search come from the spotify
  web api through your own developer app. the first launch walks u through it:
  make an app in the [spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard),
  add `http://127.0.0.1:8898/login` as a redirect uri, and paste the apps client id
  into swiftify. u dont need the client secret.

## Building from source

### Build requirements

- Qt 6.9 or newer: Qt Base, Qt Declarative and Qt Shader Tools
- QtKeychain and QCoro 0.10 or newer, both built for Qt 6
- CMake 3.24 or newer, Ninja, and a C++20 compiler
- Rust (stable, from [rustup](https://rustup.rs))

the first cmake run needs internet: it pulls [Corrosion](https://github.com/corrosion-rs/corrosion)
(which builds the rust core as part of the cmake build) and two fonts, Material Symbols
Rounded and Google Sans Flex, each checked against a pinned hash.

the commands below skip the tests with `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`. drop that and run
`ctest --test-dir build` if u want them.

### macOS

u need [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and apple's command line tools (`xcode-select --install`, or full xcode). then:

```sh
brew install qtbase qtdeclarative qtshadertools qtkeychain qcoro6 cmake ninja
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

git clone https://github.com/shredos67/swiftify.git
cd swiftify
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
cmake --build build
ditto build/swiftify.app /Applications/Swiftify.app
```

it's signed ad hoc, so no developer account needed.
with full xcode installed the icon gets compiled with `actool` and picks up macos 26's glass,
dark and tinted looks; with just the command line tools it's built from the PNGs.

### Linux

on arch either build a proper package, which installs to `/usr`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shredos67/swiftify.git
cd swiftify/packaging/arch
makepkg -si
```
or use cmake:

```sh
# replace with your package manager if not on arch
sudo pacman -S --needed git qt6-base qt6-declarative qt6-shadertools qt6-wayland qtkeychain-qt6 qcoro libpulse alsa-lib openssl cmake ninja rust pkgconf

git clone https://github.com/shredos67/swiftify.git
cd swiftify
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

anywhere else, install the same reqs (Qt 6.9+ with D-Bus, OpenGL and Wayland, QtKeychain
and QCoro for Qt 6, libpulse, plus the ALSA, OpenSSL and pkg-config dev packages), then
run the last five lines above.

`cmake --install` drops `swiftify` in `~/.local/bin` (make sure that's on your `PATH`)
and the desktop entry, icons and fonts in `~/.local/share`. 

ur login gets saved in the secret service through QtKeychain, so u need something
providing one: gnome-keyring, kwallet or keepassxc.

on linux it also hooks into MPRIS (media keys, `playerctl`, shell media widgets),
logind (pauses before the machine sleeps), pipewire/pulseaudio device changes, and
the tray. `-DSWIFTIFY_DESKTOP_INTEGRATION=OFF` turns those off.

### Windows (untested)

install visual studio 2022 (or just its build tools) with *Desktop development with C++*,
Qt 6.9+ for *MSVC 2022 64-bit* with *Qt Shader Tools* from the qt online installer,
rust from [rustup](https://rustup.rs), and git. then open an
*x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022*, set `QT` to wherever ur qt is, and paste:

```bat
set QT=C:\Qt\6.11.2\msvc2022_64
cd /d %USERPROFILE%

git clone https://github.com/frankosterfeld/qtkeychain
cmake -S qtkeychain -B qtkeychain\build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_WITH_QT6=ON -DBUILD_TEST_APPLICATION=OFF -DBUILD_TRANSLATIONS=OFF -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%QT% -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\deps
cmake --build qtkeychain\build --target install

git clone https://github.com/qcoro/qcoro
cmake -S qcoro -B qcoro\build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_QT_VERSION=6 -DQCORO_WITH_QTDBUS=OFF -DQCORO_WITH_QTWEBSOCKETS=OFF -DQCORO_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%QT% -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\deps
cmake --build qcoro\build --target install

git clone https://github.com/shredos67/swiftify.git
cd swiftify
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="%QT%;C:\deps"
cmake --build build
cmake --install build --prefix "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Swiftify"
%QT%\bin\windeployqt --release --qmldir qml "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Swiftify\bin\swiftify.exe"
copy C:\deps\bin\*.dll "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Swiftify\bin\"
```

that builds qtkeychain and qcoro into `C:\deps`, then swiftify, installs it to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Swiftify` and copies in all the dlls it needs. run
`swiftify.exe` from there or make a shortcut to it.

## Command line

only one swiftify runs at a time. launching it again just passes the command to the one
that's already running, so these work great as keybinds:

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--immersive` | open the immersive player |
| `--play-pause` | play or pause |
| `--next` | next song |
| `--previous` | previous song |

on hyprland for example:

```ini
bind = SUPER SHIFT, M, exec, swiftify --immersive
bind = , XF86AudioPlay, exec, swiftify --play-pause
```
